# Recurring services → daily workday planner

The pure TypeScript adapter `src/domain/daily-workflow.ts` connects recurring service agreements with the existing baseline scheduler.

Inputs: operator-local ISO date, service agreements, optional extra jobs, completed/skipped visit IDs, working hours, job cap, start/end depot and a precomputed drive-time matrix.

Outputs: selected ordered visits with predicted start/finish times, projected revenue and driving minutes, due count, handled count, and an explicit list of recurring visits that could not fit.

**Important limits:** The planning adapter remains a greedy baseline and requires a travel matrix; synthetic matrices are development-only. It does not provide real-road routing, optimize a route or send customer updates. The authenticated day endpoint supplies saved business records, and Today derives the visible queue from those records.

Do not schedule a visit twice. Do not silently drop visits that cannot fit. The operator reviews and approves the saved work order before starting a scheduled visit. Approval is saved in secure device storage for the signed-in operator and bound to the business, local date, visit order and estimate snapshot. The latest approved queue replaces that operator’s previous local approval; a queue change requires a fresh approval. Approval is device-local and does not sync across devices.

The review branch includes authenticated tenant-scoped completion and skip writes. Today asks for confirmation before skipping a visit, refreshes saved data after the write, and protects completed or active visits from skip transitions. These changes remain unmerged and undeployed.

Next: real-device acceptance for the review, start, completion and skip flow, including secure approval restore after app restart. Server-synced approvals, real road travel, owner-controlled replanning and customer updates remain future integrations.
